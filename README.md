[Lexing Xie](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~xlx/) is a Professor of Computer Science at the Australian National University (ANU), where she leads the ANU Computational Media Lab and directs the ANU-wide Integrated AI Network. Her research spans machine learning, computational social science, and computational economics, with a particular focus on online optimization, neural networks for sequences and networks, and applied problems such as modeling popularity in social media, vision and language, decision-making by humans and machines. Her work has been supported by the Australian Research Council, CSIRO, AFOSR, and the Data to Decisions CRC. Lexing received the 2023 ARC Future Fellowship and the 2018 Chris Wallace Award for Outstanding Research. Her research has garnered seven best paper and best student paper awards at ACM and IEEE conferences between 2002 and 2019. Among her many editorial roles, she served as the inaugural Editor-in-Chief of the AAAI International Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM) and will be the Program Co-Chair of ACM Multimedia 2024. Prior to joining ANU, she was a Research Staff Member at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in New York. She holds a PhD in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University and a BS in Electrical Engineering from Tsinghua University.

**Understanding Online Attention: From Items to Markets**. What makes a video popular? What drives collective attention online? What are the similarities and differences between clicks and transactions in a market? This talk aims to address these three questions. First, I will discuss a physics-inspired stochastic time series model that explains and forecasts the seemingly unpredictable patterns of viewership over time. This model provides novel metrics for predicting expected popularity gains per share and assessing sensitivity to promotions. Next, I will describe new measurement studies and machine learning models that analyze how networks of online items influence each otherâ€™s attention. Finally, I will introduce a macroscopic view of attention, offering mathematical descriptions of market equilibriums and distributed optimization. These results lay the groundwork for our ongoing research into the computational view of attention markets and potential mechanisms for fostering a healthy online ecosystem. Additionally, I will present an overview of Influence Flower, an interactive web app and arXiv plugin designed for qualitatively visualizing the intellectual influence of academic entities. I suggest that this tool, along with the research on attention, raises many intriguing questions and offers insights into knowledge creation and the dynamics of attention within crowds.
