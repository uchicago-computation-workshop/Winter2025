[Sarah Elwood](https://geography.washington.edu/people/sarah-elwood) is a Professor in the Department of Geography at the University of Washington, and a faculty affiliate of the UW’s West Coast Poverty Center, Center for Studies in Demography and Ecology, and Certificate in Public Scholarship. With Vicky Lawson, she co-directs the Relational Poverty Network (RPN), a transnational interdisciplinary community of scholars collaborating to develop conceptual frameworks, research methodologies, and pedagogies for the study of relational poverty. Elwood received her Ph.D. in Geography from the University of Minnesota and previously held faculty positions at DePaul University and the University of Arizona. Her research contributes to relational poverty studies, critical GIScience and digital geographies, visual politics and mixed methods, and urban geography. Current activities include research on poverty politics of creative activisms around homelessness, feminist and critical race theorizations of digital geographies, and a collaborative public scholarly project on horizons of critical poverty studies under emerging nationalist populisms.

**Stop the Sweeps: Insurgent Knowledge Politics and the Computational City**. This paper thinks through algorithmic and data-driven regulation as terrains of struggle over urban space and inhabitations, through a close reading of data praxes and politics around homelessness. With urban management practices and ideologies of good government increasingly prioritizing data-driven algorithmic processes, the
computational city runs on ‘data circuits’: Mundane data collection that encodes myriad dimensions of everyday life; administrative codes that enable or prohibit particular urban inhabitations; and the
actions (repair, regulation, removal, etc.) that these data and codes make possible. These data circuits function as administrative state violence enacted on unsheltered living in public space in tent
encampments – rendering them visible and removable, compelling disclosure of personal data, and forcing compliance as a condition of receiving shelter or other assistance. Yet precarious communities and
their allies continue to confront these forces of governance and removal through insurgent knowledge politics that circulate dramatically different possibilities for urban inhabitations calibrated around solidarity, self-determination and staying put. I develop these arguments through a close reading of the social media tactics and away-from-keys activisms of Stop the Sweeps, a loosely connected horizontal network of local collectivities fighting state-sanctioned eviction of encampments of unsheltered people in cities and towns across the US.

[Lexing Xie](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~xlx/) is a Professor of Computer Science at the Australian National University (ANU), where she leads the ANU Computational Media Lab and directs the ANU-wide Integrated AI Network. Her research spans machine learning, computational social science, and computational economics, with a particular focus on online optimization, neural networks for sequences and networks, and applied problems such as modeling popularity in social media, vision and language, decision-making by humans and machines. Her work has been supported by the Australian Research Council, CSIRO, AFOSR, and the Data to Decisions CRC. Lexing received the 2023 ARC Future Fellowship and the 2018 Chris Wallace Award for Outstanding Research. Her research has garnered seven best paper and best student paper awards at ACM and IEEE conferences between 2002 and 2019. Among her many editorial roles, she served as the inaugural Editor-in-Chief of the AAAI International Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM) and will be the Program Co-Chair of ACM Multimedia 2024. Prior to joining ANU, she was a Research Staff Member at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in New York. She holds a PhD in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University and a BS in Electrical Engineering from Tsinghua University.

**Understanding Online Attention: From Items to Markets**. What makes a video popular? What drives collective attention online? What are the similarities and differences between clicks and transactions in a market? This talk aims to address these three questions. First, I will discuss a physics-inspired stochastic time series model that explains and forecasts the seemingly unpredictable patterns of viewership over time. This model provides novel metrics for predicting expected popularity gains per share and assessing sensitivity to promotions. Next, I will describe new measurement studies and machine learning models that analyze how networks of online items influence each other’s attention. Finally, I will introduce a macroscopic view of attention, offering mathematical descriptions of market equilibriums and distributed optimization. These results lay the groundwork for our ongoing research into the computational view of attention markets and potential mechanisms for fostering a healthy online ecosystem. Additionally, I will present an overview of Influence Flower, an interactive web app and arXiv plugin designed for qualitatively visualizing the intellectual influence of academic entities. I suggest that this tool, along with the research on attention, raises many intriguing questions and offers insights into knowledge creation and the dynamics of attention within crowds.
